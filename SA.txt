<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 15px;">Blinken: We will discuss "our deep concerns with actions by China"</p>
</center>

<hr style="width: 81%; margin-top: 15px;"></hr>

<p>US and Chinese officials have exchanged sharp rebukes in the first high-level talks between the Biden administration and China, taking place in Alaska.</p>

<p>Chinese officials accused the US of inciting countries "to attack China", while the US said China had "arrived intent on grandstanding". Relations between the two superpowers are at their most strained for years. The US pledged to raise contentious issues such as Beijing's treatment of Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang.</p>

<p>The ill-tempered talks in Anchorage involved Secretary of State Antony Blinken and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan on the US side, facing off with China's most senior foreign policy official, Yang Jiechi, and foreign minister Wang Yi.</p>

<p>However, a US official said the subsequent talks behind closed doors had been "substantive, serious and direct" and ran over the planned two hours.</p>

<p>In a blunt opening statement before the talks in private, Mr Blinken said the US would "discuss our deep concerns with actions by China, including in Xinjiang, Hong Kong, Taiwan, cyber attacks on the United States, economic coercion of our allies".</p>

<p>"Each of these actions threaten the rules-based order that maintains global stability," he said.</p>

<p>In response, Mr Yang accused Washington of using its military might and financial supremacy to suppress other countries. "It abuses so-called notions of national security to obstruct normal trade exchanges, and incite some countries to attack China," he added. Mr Yang said human rights in the US were at a low point, with black Americans being "slaughtered".</p>

<p>Mr Sullivan hit back, saying Washington did not seek a conflict with China, but added: "We will always stand up for our principles for our people, and for our friends."</p>

<p>The exchange, which took place in front of the world's media, went on for more than an hour. It came at the start of three sessions, which are due to end on Friday morning.</p>

<p>It is the first high-level meeting between the US and China since last June - during the administration of the previous US President, Donald Trump.</p>

<h1>China and Taiwan face off in pineapple war</h1>
<hr></hr>

<p>It could be the world's most heated dispute over pineapple, even eclipsing the interminable debate about whether or not it belongs on pizza.</p>

<p>Last month, China banned Taiwanese pineapple imports, citing the risk of "harmful creatures" that could affect its own crops. The move infuriated Taiwan's leaders, who said the move had nothing to do with bugs, and was instead an example of China ramping up political pressure on the island, which Beijing considers a province of China.</p>

<p>In response, Taiwan's leaders sought out new customers overseas, and asked locals to eat what Chinese consumers no longer could.</p>

<p>"Taiwanese pineapples are stronger than fighter jets. Geopolitical pressures cannot squeeze their deliciousness," declared Taiwanâ€™s Vice President Lai Ching-te, in a tweet.</p>

<p>According to Taiwan's Council of Agriculture, the island produces 420,000 tonnes of pineapple annually, and exported a little over 10% of that last year, with almost all of it going to China. Without mainland sales, Taiwanese growers face a possible glut of pineapples, and with it a danger that prices might fall.</p>

<h3>Freedom pineapples</h3>
<p>President Tsai Ing-wen launched a "pineapple challenge" on social media, aimed at getting Taiwanese consumers to buy more of the fruit.</p>
<p></p>

<center>
<p style="margin-left: 250px; margin-right: 250px;">After Australian wine, unfair Chinese trade practices are now targeting #Taiwanese pineapples. But that won't stop us. Whether in a smoothie, a cake, or freshly cut on a plate, our pineapples always hit the spot. Support our farmers & enjoy delicious Taiwanese fruit!</p>
<p>- Tsai Ing-wen (@iingwen) February 26, 2021</p>
</center>

<p></p>
<p>Taiwan's Foreign Minister Joseph Wu used his Ministry's Twitter account to "urge like-minded friends around the globe to stand with #Taiwan & rally behind the #FreedomPineapple".</p>

<p>The de facto embassies of the US and Canada in Taiwan were happy to oblige. The American Institute in Taiwan posted a number of pictures to its Facebook page, including one of its director Brent Christensen with three pineapples on his desk. The Canadian Trade Office in Taipei posted a photo of staff posing around a pineapple pizza, with a polite reminder that it was Canada's idea rather than Hawaii's. "We in the Canadian Office like pineapple pizza, especially pineapples from Taiwan!" the post said. Japanese consumers might have made the biggest difference, with orders for 5,000 tonnes coming from Japan, Ms Tsai said.</p>

<p>Many Japanese Twitter users also expressed their support.</p>

<p>"I will definitely buy some. I tried it last year and realized that even its core is eatable. Now I love its juicy sweet taste," one user wrote.</p>

<p>Within just a few days the Taiwanese government's campaign led to enough orders to cover the pineapples that would have been exported to China. That still leaves the 90% of pineapples growers usually sell domestically, so they will be hoping that consumers don't get sick of the taste.</p>

<p>Yang Yufan, a well-known organic pineapple grower from Southern Taiwan, has become known as the "pineapple prince".</p>

<p>He told BBC Chinese that in recent years Taiwanese growers had gravitated to the Chinese market, because inspections were easier and faster than in other markets like Japan. But he said Taiwan's agriculture sector needed to diversify because too much of its exports go to mainland China. "The pineapples we hope to harvest next year will [have been] sown last year, so the problems we will face next year may be even greater," he said.</p>

<h1>Detained BBC journalist Aung Thura released</h1>
<hr></hr>

<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 15px;">Aung Thura has been released from detention</p>
</center>

<hr style="width: 81%; margin-top: 15px;"></hr>

<p>Detained BBC journalist Aung Thur has been released in Myanmar, days after he was detained.</p>

<p>The BBC Burmese service reporter had been taken away by men in plain clothes on 19 March while reporting outside a court in the capital, Nay Pyi Taw. Forty journalists have been arrested since the civilian government was overthrown in a military coup on 1 February. The military has also revoked the licences of five media companies.</p>

<p>Last Friday, Aung Thura was taken away with another reporter, Than Htike Aung, who works for the local news organisation Mizzima. Mizzima's operating licence was revoked by the military government earlier this month.</p>

<p>The men who detained the journalists had arrived in an unmarked van at around midday local time (05:30 GMT) and demanded to see them. The BBC was unable to contact him after that.</p>

<p>The BBC confirmed his release on Monday, but gave no further details.</p>

<p>According to the UN, at least 149 people have died during the civil disobedience, though the actual figure is thought to be much higher. One of the bloodiest days was 14 March when 38 were confirmed to have been killed.</p>

<p>A joint statement by European Union embassies and those of the US and the UK condemned "the brutal violence against unarmed civilians by security forces".</p>

<p>The statement called on the military to lift martial law, release detainees, end the state of emergency and restore democracy.</p>

<p>Malaysian Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin has meanwhile criticised the use of lethal force by the military and called for "a path towards peaceful solutions". He echoed a call by the Indonesian President, Joko Widodo, for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to hold a summit on the situation in Myanmar.</p>
