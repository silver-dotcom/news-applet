<h3>They said, 'You are a savage and dangerous woman.'</h3>

<p>"I am speaking the truth. And the truth is savage and dangerous."</p>

<p>So wrote Nawal El Saadawi, who has died at the age of 89, according to Egyptian media reports.</p>

<p>The pioneering Egyptian doctor, feminist and writer spent decades sharing her own story and perspectives - in her novels, essays, autobiographies and eagerly attended talks. Her brutal honesty and unwavering dedication to improving the political and sexual rights of women inspired generations. But in daring to speak dangerously, she was also subjected to outrage, death threats and imprisonment.</p>

<p>"She was born with fighting spirit," Omnia Amin, her friend and translator, told the BBC in 2020.</p>

<p>"People like her are rare."</p>

<p>Born in a village outside Cairo in 1931, the second of nine children, El Saadawi wrote her first novel at the age of 13. Her father was a government official, with little money, while her mother came from a wealthy background. Her family tried to make her marry at the age of 10, but when she resisted her mother stood by her.</p>

<p>Her parents encouraged her education, El Saadawi wrote, but she realised at an early age that daughters were less valued than sons. Later she would describe how she stamped her foot in fury when her grandmother told her, "a boy is worth 15 girls at least... Girls are a blight".</p>

<p>"She saw something wrong and she spoke out," says Dr Amin. "Nawal can't turn her back."</p>

<p>One of the childhood experiences El Saadawi documented with uncomfortable clarity was being subjected to female genital mutilation (FGM) at the age of six. In her book, The Hidden Face of Eve, she described undergoing the agonising procedure on the bathroom floor, as her mother stood alongside.</p>

<p>She campaigned against FGM throughout her lifetime, arguing that it was a tool used to oppress women. FGM was banned in Egypt in 2008, but El Saadawi condemned its continued prevalence.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 15px;">El Saadawi, pictured in 1986, was fierce critic of religion</p>
</center>

<hr style="width: 81%; margin-top: 15px;"></hr>

<p>El Saadawi graduated with a degree in medicine from Cairo University in 1955 and worked as a doctor, eventually specialising in psychiatry. She went on to become director of public health for the Egyptian government, but was dismissed in 1972 after publishing her non-fiction book, Women and Sex, which railed against FGM and the sexual oppression of women.</p>

<p>The magazine Health, which had she founded a few years earlier, was closed down in 1973. Still, she continued to speak out and write. In 1975, she published Woman at Point Zero, a novel based on a real life account of a woman on death row she had met.</p>

<p>It was followed in 1977 by the Hidden Face of Eve, in which she documented her experiences as a village doctor witnessing sexual abuse, "honour killings" and prostitution. It caused outrage, with critics accusing her of reinforcing stereotypes of Arab women. Then, in September 1981, El Saadawi was arrested as part of a round-up of dissidents under President Anwar Sadat and held in prison for three months. There she wrote her memoirs on toilet paper, using an eyebrow pencil smuggled to her by a jailed sex worker.</p>

<p>"She did things that people just didn't venture to do, but for her it was normal," Dr Amin says. "She wasn't thinking about breaking rules or regulations, but telling her truth."</p>

<p>After President Sadat was assassinated, El Saadawi was released. But her work was censored and her books banned.</p>

<p>In the years that followed, she received death threats from religious fundamentalists, was taken to court, and eventually went into exile in the US. There she continued to level attacks against religion, colonialism and Western hypocrisy. She railed against the Muslim veil but also make-up and revealing clothes - upsetting even fellow feminists.</p>

<p>When BBC presenter Zeinab Badawi suggested during an interview in 2018 that she tone down her criticism, El Saadawi replied: "No. I should be more outspoken, I should be more aggressive, because the world is becoming more aggressive, and we need people to speak loudly against injustices.</p>

<p>"I speak loudly because I am angry."</p>

<p>As well as sparking outrage, El Saadawi gained much international recognition, with her books translated into more than 40 languages.</p>

<p>"I know people do not always agree with her politics, but what inspires me most is her writing, what she has achieved and what that can do for women," says British author and publisher Kadija Sesay, who acted as her agent in London. "Especially if you are an African woman, or a woman of colour, you will be affected by her work."</p>

<p>She received numerous honorary degrees from universities around the world. In 2020, Time magazine named her one of its 100 Women of the Year, dedicating a front cover to her.</p>

<p>But one thing would remain out of reach. "Her only dream or hope was for some acknowledgement from Egypt," Dr Amin says. "She said she had received honours worldwide, but never got anything from her own country."</p>

<p>El Saadawi returned to her beloved Egypt in 1996 and soon caused a stir. She stood as a presidential candidate in the 2004 election and was in Cairo's Tahrir Square for the 2011 uprising against President Hosni Mubarak. She spent her final years in Cairo, close to her son and daughter. As Egyptian newspapers reported her death, the simple message (in Arabic) "Nawal Al-Saadawi........ goodbye" appeared on her Facebook page.</p>

<p>"She has been through a lot," said Dr Amin. "She has affected generations. The young try to look for role models. She stands up."</p>

<p>Kadija Sesay remembers the writer for her willingness to listen to other women's stories and speaking to them about their harsh experiences. "I don't know many people, especially when they are that well known, who are that giving," she says. "But she didn't want to be anybody's hero - she'd say, 'Be your own hero'."</p>

<h1>Niger top court confirms Bazoum as new president</h1>

<hr style="width: 81%; margin-top: 15px;"></hr>

<p>Niger's constitutional court has confirmed Mohamed Bazoum of the ruling PNDS party as winner of a presidential runoff held last month.</p>

<p>Mr Bazoum won with 55.66 % of the votes while his challenger Mahamane Ousmane of the RDR-Tchanji party received 45.34% of the votes, according to the final results published on Sunday. The turnout was 62.81%.</p>

<p>The opposition coalition, Cap 2021, and its allies had contested the results, alleging fraud. It claimed victory with 50.3% of the vote.</p>

<p>On Saturday the authorities banned a planned march by the opposition in the capital, Niamey, because it was seen as a "risk to public order" and "for reasons of health emergency" related to the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>This is Niger's first transition from one democratically elected leader to another, with President Mahamadou Issoufou stepping down after two five-year terms. The new president is a former interior minister and close ally of Mr Issoufou. Niger, which is the world's poorest country, is struggling to contain an Islamist insurgency.</p>

<h1>Mozambique conflict: Why are US forces there?</h1>
<hr></hr>
<p style="font-size: 13px;">By Christopher Giles and Peter Mwai</p>
<p style="font-size: 13px;">Updated: March 21, 2021 09:10 PM IST</p>

<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 15px;">Thousands have been forced to flee their homes</p>
</center>

<hr style="width: 81%; margin-top: 15px;"></hr>

<p>A sharp increase in militant attacks in Mozambique's northern province of Cabo Delgado has forced the government to reassess its strategy against the Islamist insurgency. It has invited in US military advisers to support its own armed forces in the conflict.</p>

<h3>What is the role of US forces?</h3>

<p>The agreement between the Mozambican and US governments is for American soldiers to train local forces fighting the al-Shabaab militia - believed to have links to the wider Islamic state group (IS).</p>

<p>"US special operations forces... will support Mozambique's efforts to prevent the spread of terrorism and violent extremism," the US embassy in Mozambique said on 15 March.</p>

<p>"Clearly, the US is trying to extend its influence," says Jasmine Opperman, an analyst for the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (Acled), which monitors political violence globally. But she adds that it's a complex local conflict, and that "the US is framing the insurgency in a very over-simplified manner by referring to [the militants] as an extension of the Islamic State".</p>

<p>On March 10, the US government designated al-Shabaab in Mozambique as a "foreign terrorist organisation", describing it as an IS-affiliate.</p>

<p>Portugal, the former colonial power in Mozambique, has also committed to training the military. "We will send a staff of approximately 60 trainers to Mozambique to train marines and commandos," said a Portuguese official.</p>

<hr style="width: 81%; margin-top: 15px;"></hr>

<h3>Mercenary forces</h3>
<p>Although the Mozambican government is reticent about acknowledging their presence, private military contractors have been operating in the region alongside its security forces. Initially in 2019, Russian mercenaries from the Wagner group were involved in the region.</p>

<p>More recently, the South Africa-based Dyck Advisory Group (DAG) was believed to have been invited by the Mozambican government to help it fight insurgents.</p>

<p>A recent Amnesty International report on human rights abuses committed in Cabo Delgado implicated this group as well as government forces, and the militants in the unlawful killings of civilians.</p>

<p>The DAG says it's investigating the allegations made against it.</p>

<p>"When you hear these accusations of civilian casualties involving private military contractors, it reflects badly on the government," says Emilia Columbo, a senior associate at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies.</p>

<p>There are also concerns over the effectiveness of these private contractors.</p>

<p>Acting US counterterrorism co-ordinator John Godfrey has said the involvement of mercenaries "has not demonstrably helped" the government of Mozambique in countering the threat it faces from militants.</p>

<h3>What's driving the conflict?</h3>
<p>Cabo Delgado has long experienced instability, but the recent surge in Islamist-linked violence started in 2017. It's a region with high levels of poverty and there are grievances over access to land and jobs. But Cabo Delgado's importance for the government, and a further reason for local grievance, lies in the rich off-shore natural gas reserves currently being explored in collaboration with multinational energy companies.</p>

<p>It appears that the militants have had significant success in finding recruits both from within the province and further afield. "I would say based on how quickly they spread, it speaks to a huge increase in recruitment", says Emilia Columbo. "We get reports of boats full of youths getting intercepted on the way to Cabo Delgado."</p>

<p>Acled has recorded more than 570 violent incidents from January to December 2020 in the province. These have included killings, beheadings and kidnappings, with deaths from attacks carried out by all groups involved in the conflict rising sharply last year. The most horrifying incident was of 50 people beheaded in a sports field over the course of a weekend.</p>

<p>Human rights groups have reported the extensive destruction of buildings throughout northern Mozambique by the militants. The instability has led to huge numbers of people leaving their homes in areas where conflict has erupted.</p>

<p>Nearly 670,000 people were internally displaced in Cabo Delgado, Niassa and Nampula provinces by the end of 2020, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.</p>
