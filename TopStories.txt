<h1>Amitabh Bachchan and India's battle to preserve its film heritage</h1>
<hr></hr>

<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 15px;">A release print of the 1971 Bollywood hit Anand, starring Amitabh Bachchan, has been preserved</p>
</center>

<hr style="width: 81%; margin-top: 15px;"></hr>

<p>For decades, Amitabh Bachchan preserved some 60 of his films in an air-conditioned room in his bungalow in the western city of Mumbai.</p>

<p>Five years ago, the Bollywood superstar handed over the prints to a temperature-controlled film archive run by a city-based non-profit, which had begun restoring and preserving Indian films. Led by Shivendra Singh Dungarpur, an award-winning filmmaker, archivist and restorer, the Film Heritage Foundation has been at the forefront of these efforts. It has "built an international reputation for excellence", according to director Christopher Nolan, and Bachchan is its brand ambassador.</p>

<p>For years he has been tirelessly advocating and actively helping in trying to preserve India's fast-decaying film heritage.</p>

<p>And on Friday, Bachchan was feted for this little-known facet of his work. The 78-year-old actor was conferred this year's International Federation of Film Archives award. Nolan and fellow filmmaker Martin Scorsese gave away the award, whose stellar past recipients include the two acclaimed directors themselves and such auteurs as Ingmar Bergman, Agnes Varda and Jean-Luc-Godard.</p>

<p>Bachchan, Dungarpur says, has "always been deeply invested" in the idea of preserving and archiving cinema. During a conversation, the star once agonised over the fact that he couldn't watch some of the earlier films of the thespian Dilip Kumar because "they were simply lost".</p>

<p>India has 10 major film industries - including Bollywood, the world's largest - and produces close to 2,000 films a year in some 36 languages. But it has only two film archives - a state-run one in the western city of Pune and the non-profit, run by Dungarpur. "This is woefully inadequate given our rich and prolific film history," Dungarpur says.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, much of India's storied film heritage has been lost and damaged because of spotty conservation and preservation of film.</p>

<p>India's first talkie Alam Ara (1931) and its first locally-made colour film Kisan Kanya (1937) are untraceable. Newer films have fared no better. Original footage of a documentary on freedom heroine Lakhshmi Sahgal made by Sai Paranjpye (1977) and Shyam Benegal's Bharat Ek Khoj (1988) no longer exists. The negative of a 2009 film called Magadheera made by SS Rajamouli "disappeared in just six years", according to the director.</p>

<p>As Dungarpur tells the grim story, only 29 of 1,138 silent films made in India survive. Some 80% of the more than 2,000 films made in Mumbai - then Bombay - between 1931 and 1950 are unavailable for viewing.</p>

<p>Last year, Dungarpur and his team found 200 films languishing in sacks in a warehouse in Mumbai. "They were prints and negatives, and someone had just dumped them," he says.</p>

<p>That's not all. According to government auditors 31,000 reels of film held by the state-run film archives have been lost or destroyed.</p>

<p>In 2003, more than 600 films were reportedly damaged in a fire in the state-run archive - among them were original prints of the last few existing reels of the 1913 classic Raja Harishchandra, India's first silent film. "You have to respect your past. To respect your past you need to preserve and restore your films," says director Gautam Ghosh.</p>

<p>Before digital arrived, films were usually preserved as original negatives, duplicates of those negatives and prints that were released for viewing. After most Indian filmmakers stopped shooting on film in 2014, Dungarpur says, many film labs digitised their stock, and threw away the negatives, thinking that they had no use for them. "The original camera negative has a much higher resolution than digital today. That's what they didn't know."</p>

<p>Now, preservationists in India mainly work on prints. "It's a complete disaster. We had to try create a completely new awareness about celluloid film and its history".</p>

<p>"Very little of our film heritage survives and if we do not take urgent steps to save what remains, in another 100 years there will be no memory of all those who came before us and captured our lives through the moving image."</p>

<h1>India seals Myanmar border amid strains over refugee crisis</h1>

<h3>Mizoram Chief Minister Zoramthanga talks to Myanmar Foreign Minister Zin Mar Aung as Centre checks influx.</h3>

<p>Mizoram Chief Minister Zoramthanga held a virtual meeting on Sunday with Foreign Minister of Myanmar Zin Mar Aung amid the ongoing military crackdown following the February coup, even as India has sealed all entry points along the border with the southeast Asian neighbour and is closely monitoring to prevent any Myanmar nationals from entering the country.</p>

<p>"Had a fruitful meeting (online) this morning with Zin Mar Aung, Hon'ble Foreign Minister, Myanmar. Our thoughts and prayers are with Myanmar in these trying times," Mr. Zoramthanga said on Twitter. He had earlier written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi urging intervention so that "political refugees" from Myanmar are given asylum to give food and shelter in the country.</p>

<p>The tussle between the Centre and State over the issue has created a tough time for New Delhi and security agencies in handling situation on the ground, according to multiple officials.</p>

<p>In the letter dated March 18, Mr. Zoramthanga said the people residing on both sides have close linkages. "India cannot turn a blind eye to the humanitarian crisis unfolding in front of us in our own backyard," he had said.</p>

<p>The letter comes after a series of exchanges between the State and the Centre over the handling of the refugees. Stating that whole of Myanmar is in turmoil and "innocent hapless citizens are being persecuted" by the military regime who are supposed to be their guardians and protectors, Mr. Zoramthanga said the "Myanmar area bordering Mizoram is inhabited by Chin communities who are ethnically our brethren with whom we have been having close contacts throughout all these years even before India became independent."</p>

<p>Following the February 1 coup when the Myanmar military overthrew the democratically elected government, around 300 Myanmarese nationals including many policemen have crossed into India and sought refuge.</p>

<p>There is considerable support and sympathy among the people of Mizoram over the situation in Myanmar as many have relations across the border, a government official stated adding, it was a very emotive and sensitive issue in the State.</p>

<p>India and Myanmar have an arrangement called Free Movement Regime (FMR) which allows locals on both sides to go upto 16 km across the other side and stay upto 14 days. Thousands of Myanmarese nationals visit regularly for work and to meet relatives. In March 2020, FMR was suspended due to COVID-2019 and no one has been being allowed since. The fallout of this, officials said, was that there has been an increase smuggling across the border as the livelihood of people has been disrupted due to the pandemic.</p>

<p>On February 26, the State government had issued a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) to Deputy Commissioners detailing how the refugees are to be handled. This was subsequently revoked after directions from the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA).</p>

<p>After the MHA directive, no one is being allowed to enter India from Myanmar and the Assam Rifles, which is the border guarding force there, is keeping a close watch, said a second local official. However, the border is porous and unlike the Bangladesh border, over 60% of which is fenced, the Myanmar border is unfenced and completely blocking it not possible given the tough terrain. Mizoram shares a 510 km long border with Mizoram.</p>

<p>All the refugees who have come in earlier have been housed in camps along the border by the local administration and security forces have no direct access.</p>

<p>For central agencies and Assam Rifles on the ground, it is a tricky situation in maintaining a delicate balance in executing the MHA orders and maintaining the cordial relations with the States agencies and the locals, the official added.</p>

<p>In a letter to the four States bordering Myanmar dated March 10, MHA said State governments have no powers to grant refugee status to any foreigner and India is not a signatory to the United Nations Refugee Convention of 1951 and its 1967 Protocol.</p>

<h1>UK extradites drug syndicate kingpin Kishan Singh to India</h1>
<hr></hr>

<p>In a significant development, Kishan Singh, accused of running an international drug cartel, has been extradited to India from London, sources told India Today.</p>

<p>Kishan Singh, a British citizen who hails from Rajasthan, was arrested by the UK authorities on August 23, 2018, on the request of Indian authorities and later granted bail.</p>

<p>During the extradition hearing, the UK's Westminster Magistrates' Court, relying on the evidence against him, ordered his extradition to India in May, 2019.</p>

<p>38-year-old Kishan Singh, however, challenged the extradition on grounds that he will not get a fair trial in India if he is sent back. The court, however, did not accept his arguments. On Sunday, Kishan Singh was sent back to India in a flight to face trial in the case, sources said.</p>

<p>Kishan Singh has been accused of supplying mephedrone (meow meow), amphetamines and other recreational party drugs to India.</p>

<p>The case came to light when athlete and Common Wealth Games' silver medalist Harpreet Singh was arrested in February 2017 by the police. Two alleged associates of Kishan Singh, Amandeep Singh and Harnish Sarpal, were also arrested by the police from Delhi with 25 kg mephedrone in their possession.</p>

<p>Kishan Singh, as per the extradition conditions, will be kept in Delhi's Tihar jail.</p>
