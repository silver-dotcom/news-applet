<h1>West Bengal Assembly elections: United colours of an OBC promise</h1>

<p>The Trinamool Congress manifesto released by Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday stressed on OBC reservation for groups such as the Mahisyas, Tamuls, Sahas and Tilis. Just a day earlier, BJP national president J P Nadda had announced at a poll rally that if the party came to power in West Bengal, it would provide reservation in the OBC category for these communities.</p>

<h3>The OBC vote</h3>

<p>The 2019 Lok Sabha results indicated major gains by the BJP in areas dominated by SCs, STs and OBCs, specifically in south Bengal, where this helped the party crack the stronghold of the Trinamool. If the transfer of SC/ST votes helped the BJP get better results in Jangalmahal and North 24 Parganas and Nadia districts, the shift of OBC votes helped the party win seats in districts like East and West Midnapore, Hooghly and Howrah.</p>

<p>If the BJP is now trying to consolidate this hold, the Trinamool is hoping the promise of reservation will return the OBCs to it.</p>

<h3>The Mahisya legacy</h3>

<p>Together, the Mahisyas, Tomars, Tilis and Sahas are believed to wield significant influence in at least 50 constituencies in South Bengal. Birendranath Sashmal, Sushil Dhara and Satish Samanta are leaders belonging to these groups who led the freedom movement against the British in the area, even forming a 'Tamralipta Jatiya Sarkar', an "independent parallel government", during the Quit India Movement. It functioned from December 17, 1942, to August 8, 1944, setting up police stations and even a system for revenue collection.</p>
<p>From the beginning of his campaign, Adhikari has been harping on his Midnapore identity and paying homage to leaders like Dhara, Samanta, Sashmal - in line with the BJP's successful invocation of local, little-known leaders across the country.</p>

<h1>Australia floods: Thousands evacuated as downpours worsen</h1>
<hr></hr>

<center><img src="file:Briefs4.jpg">
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 15px;">Towns on the New South Wales coast like Port Macquarie have been badly affected</p>
</center>

<hr style="width: 81%; margin-top: 15px;"></hr>

<p>About 18,000 Australians have been evacuated from flooding across New South Wales (NSW) as heavy rain continues to batter the east coast. Days of torrential downpours have caused rivers and dams to overflow around Sydney - the state capital - and in south-east Queensland.</p>

<p>Officials say the "one-in-a-50-year event" may continue all week and have urged the public to exercise caution.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Scott Morrison has offered funds for those forced to flee. "It's another testing time for our country," he told Sydney radio station 2GB on Monday.</p>

<p>There has been widespread damage in the affected areas, which are home to about a third of Australia's 25 million people.</p>

<p>NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said many of the communities "being battered by the floods" had been affected by bushfires and drought the previous summer. "I don't know any time in state history where we have had these extreme weather conditions in such quick succession in the middle of a pandemic," she said.</p>

<p>Emergency services have conducted at least 500 rescues, including winching people from cars. One stranded family was lifted from their flooded home by a helicopter. Responders also saved a family with an infant from flooding in their home in Sydney's west.</p>

<p>Australia's Bureau of Meteorology has said the rainfall - up to 1,000mm in some areas - has been "extraordinary" in the recent days. On Monday, authorities were most concerned about residents in the low-lying areas north and west of Sydney, the NSW Central Coast and the Hawkesbury valley, as the weather system swept inland.</p>

<h3>What has happened so far?</h3>

<p>The flooding has caused havoc across NSW, forcing 15,000 evacuations on the state's Mid-North Coast and a further 3,000 in Sydney, officials said.</p>

<p>Swollen rivers have cut off roads and bridges and forced about 150 schools to shut on Monday. There have been images of livestock floating through flooded areas and rows of houses engulfed up to their windows.</p>

<p>The Hawkesbury and Nepean rivers - which border Sydney to the north and west - reached higher levels on Monday than during a devastating flood in 1961. Forecasters said the Hawkesbury river could peak at around 13m (42ft) later in the day. In addition, the Warragamba Dam, Sydney's main water source, has began spilling over for the first time in five years. Authorities said it was discharging about 500 gigalitres a day - equivalent to the volume of Sydney Harbour.</p>

<p>On Sunday a young couple saw their house north of Sydney swept away by flash floods on what should have been their wedding day. Shocked neighbours filmed the uprooted three-bedroom cottage bobbing along the Manning river after it burst its banks.</p>

<p>Flights have been suspended at Newcastle Airport - about 17km (72 miles) north of Sydney - after the runway flooded. Authorities have also reported landslides and damage to homes from a mini-tornado which hit west of Sydney on Saturday.</p>

<p>A total of 18 council areas have been lashed across NSW. In south-east Queensland, flash floods also affected Brisbane and the Gold Coast on the weekend but conditions had eased slightly by Monday.</p>

<h3>From fires to floods</h3

<p>The intense summer of rain and floods in eastern Australia is a stark contrast to a year ago, when many of the same areas were scorched by mammoth bushfires and ravaged by drought.</p>

<p>This side of the continent is currently experiencing a La Nina weather pattern, which typically brings more rainfall and tropical cyclones during summer.</p>

<p>Two of Australia's three wettest years on record have been during La Nina events. Typically a La Nina sees a 20% increase in average rainfall from December to March in eastern Australia.</p>

<p>Scientists say that climate change is also intensifying La Nina's impact, and making weather patterns more erratic.</p>

<p>All that must be achieved while the world's third-biggest emitter also meets the aspirations of 1.4 billion people for faster economic development, which will only happen with an accelerated pace of industrialization and energy demand. </p>

<p>Top government officials are debating whether to set a target for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Doing so would mean an overhaul of a coal-reliant energy sector, transport, heavy industry and even the nation's sluggish bureaucracy. All that must be achieved while the world's third-biggest emitter also meets the aspirations of 1.4 billion people for faster economic development, which will only happen with an accelerated pace of industrialization and energy demand.</p>

<p>Committing to a legally binding net-zero target would help India attract some of the trillions of dollars in investment that'll be required for a green transformation, lawmaker Jayant Sinha, a member of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party and an advocate of a 2050 goal, said in an interview.</p>

<p>"The world is not going to achieve its targets of halting global warming unless India is able to reduce its carbon emissions and India changes its trajectory right now," Sinha said.</p>

<h1>East Ladakh stand-off with China on US top official Lloyd Austin's India agenda</h1>
<hr></hr>

<center><img src="file:Briefs3.jpg">
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 15px;">US defence secretary Lloyd Austin's arrival in Delhi coincides with a crucial meeting<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 15px;">between top officials of the Biden administration and President Xi Jinping's China in Alaska</p>
</center>

<hr style="width: 81%; margin-top: 15px;"></hr>

<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to meet US defence secretary Lloyd Austin after 6 pm today to deepen bilateral defence cooperation and further Quad.</p>

<p>China's aggression in Ladakh, terrorism in the region and steps to further cement India-US defence ties will be on the top of the agenda when the US defence secretary Lloyd Austin arrives in India this evening for the first in-person engagement between the Modi government and Joe Biden administration, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.</p>

<p>"This is Secretary Austin's first visit abroad after the Quad summit and the first high-level visit by a senior representative of the new US administration. Meetings will be on broad issues, not a detailed exchange of specifics," said a senior government official.</p>

<p>India is the third stop of Austin's three-nation tour, an effort by the Biden administration to bolster a united front against China which was famously described by Austin as the "pacing threat".</p>
