<p>A five-judge Constitution bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan was vehemently told by senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Maharashtra, that the Mandal judgement on capping the quota needed a re-look in changed circumstances.</p>

<p>For how many generations would reservations in jobs and education continue, the Supreme Court sought to know during the Maratha quota case hearing on Friday and raised concerns over resultant inequality in case the overall 50 per cent limit was to be removed. A five-judge Constitution bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan was vehemently told by senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Maharashtra, that the Mandal judgement on capping the quota needed a re-look in changed circumstances.</p>

<p>He said the courts should leave it to states to fix reservation quotas in view of the changed circumstances and the Mandal judgement was premised on census of 1931. Arguing in favour of the Maharashtra law granting quota to Marathas, Rohatgi referred to various aspects of the Mandal judgement, also known as Indra Sawhney case, and said the Centre's decision to grant 10 per cent quota to people from economically weaker section also breached the 50 per cent cap. If there is no 50 per cent or no limit, as you are suggesting, what is the concept of equality then. We will ultimately have to deal with it. What is your reflection on thatâ€¦ What about the resultant inequality. How many generations will you continue, observed the bench, which also comprised Justices L Nageswara Rao, S Abdul Nazeer, Hemant Gupta and S Ravindra Bhat.</p>

<p>Rohatgi said there were many reasons for the re-look of the Mandal judgment which was premised on the census of 1931 and moreover, the population has increased many fold and reached to 135 crore. The bench said 70 years have passed since independence and the states have been carrying on so many beneficial schemes and can we accept that no development has taken place, that no backward caste has moved forward.</p>

<p>It also observed that the purpose of reviewing the Mandal judgement was that those who have come out from backwardness must be eliminated. Yes, we have moved forward. But it is not that backward classes have gone down from 50 to 20 per cent. We still have starvation deaths in this country.... I am not trying to say that Indra Sawhney is completely wrong, throw it in the dustbin. I am raising issues that 30 years have gone by, the law has changed, the population has grown, backward persons may also have increased, Rohatgi said.</p>

<p>He referred to amendments made in the Constitution and said they are the indicators that the country has not reached anywhere near the emancipation it required for its backwards classes. The fact of the matter is Parliament should know what is going on in the country. If Parliament knows it is more than 50 per cent and has given 10 per cent to a class of economically backward section, no warrant from court should say it cannot go over 50 per cent, he argued.</p>

<p>When a number of states have reservations exceeding 50 per cent and in this situation, it cannot be said that this is not a burning issue and does not require a relook after 30 years, he said. The arguments in the case remained inconclusive and would resume on Monday.</p>

<p>On Thursday, Attorney General K K Venugopal had told the apex court that the 102nd amendment to the Constitution does not deprive state legislatures to enact law determining the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) and conferring benefits on them. The 102nd Constitution amendment Act of 2018 inserted Articles 338B, which deals with the structure, duties and powers of the National Commission for Backward Class (NCBC), and 342A dealing with power of the President to notify a particular caste as SEBC as also of Parliament to change the list.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, the top court was told that Marathas have been dominant socially and politically as almost 40 per cent of MPs and MLAs of Maharashtra are from this community and the entire hypothesis that they have been left behind, faced historical injustice is completely flawed. The top court has been hearing a clutch of cases challenging the Bombay High Court verdict which upheld the grant of quota to Marathas in admissions and government jobs in the state.</p>

<h1>Helping migrant children get basic education</h1>
<hr></hr>

<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 15px;">Migrant children learning their lessons at the makeshift school set up on the outskirts of Kammarachedu village in Ballari district</p>
</center>

<hr style="width: 81%; margin-top: 15px;"></hr>

<p>Around 50 families from different villages in Anantapur district, Andhra Pradesh, migrate to Kammarachedu village in Ballari district, for three months every year for agricultural work. While the adults of the families go to the farm fields in the surrounding villages, the children, the old and the sick spend their days in the temporary tent camp that they set up on the outskirts of the village.</p>

<p>Though the workers hail from particular villages in the neighbouring State, they don't have a definite place to live as they move from one place to another in search of livelihood.</p>

<p>The uncertainty of their place of living deprives their children of formal schooling. The Constitutional provision that mandates the State to provide free and compulsory education to all children in the six to 14 age group has no meaning for these children.</p>

<p>However, fortunately this time, the nomadic children have something to cheer about. Sanmarga Geleyara Balaga, a Ballari-based group of charity-oriented individuals, set up a makeshift school in the camp about a month ago to ensure that the children are not deprived of their right to education. The self-funded organisation has appointed two Bachelor of Education degree holders as instructors for an honorarium of Rs 6,000 a month. It has provided the children with study and exercise material such as slates and books that were procured from donors. It is also providing food, sweet and snacks to the children. All the 44 children in the camp are attending classes that are scheduled between 4.30 p.m. and 7 p.m. every day.</p>

<p>"I am astonished and happy to see the progress of the children. Only around 10 children who had opportunities to attend anganwadis in the places where their parents had migrated to had some knowledge about the alphabet and numbers. The rest of the children were literally illiterate. In a short span of about 25 days, they have improved a lot. I feel content to see the children's enthusiasm. I have also been deprived of formal education after completing Class IV. Even today, I feel embarrassed and uncomfortable when I come across messages in English or situations where I am expected to be more knowledgeable. I always feel that none should face the situation that I had," B. Chandrashekhar Acharya, secretary of the group, told The Hindu.</p>

<p>Ballari Additional Deputy Commissioner P.S. Manjunath, who inaugurated the makeshift school, has offered all possible assistance for the children's education after seeing the learning enthusiasm in them.</p>

<p>The Sanmarga Geleyara Balaga, which does all of its social service activities from donations from its members and well-wishers, a majority of whom are well-settled government officers working in Ballari district and beyond, is also ready to offer assistance even after the children move from Ballari along with their parents.</p>

<p>Over 200 students from Indira Gandhi Delhi Technological University for Women will mentor 1,000 girl students of Delhi government schools in grades 9 to 12 under the AAP dispensation's "Education Mentoring Programme" launched on Saturday.</p>

<p>The Delhi Government launched the programme" through its "Youth for Education" initiative, which focuses on mentoring girls studying in grades 9 to 12.</p>

<p>According to Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, BTech, MTech, PhD and MBA students of the university will mentor these students. Initially 200 students will mentor 1,000 students, he said.</p>

<p>"Our world is becoming a knowledge economy, with dedicated research and innovation quickly becoming key to progress.</p>

<p>"Although our nation is seeing some major innovations in every field of work, these innovations are mostly led by men. The participation of women is abysmal when it comes to innovation, especially in the field of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), he said.</p>

<p>He said with the Education Mentoring Programme, the Delhi government wants to empower students of Delhi in the fields of STEM.</p>

<p>"We want our students, especially our girls, to receive the right guidance, which will help them build sustainable innovations. It is our vision that our girls equally dominate the STEM sector," Sisodia said.</p>

<p>Under the Education Mentoring Programme, each IGDTUW mentor will guide five girls studying in grades 9 to 12, clearing their doubts related to careers in STEM, share strategies for clearing entrance exams, support in accessing learning resources and motivate them as they transition from school to colleges and careers.</p>
