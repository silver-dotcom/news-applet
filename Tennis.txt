<h3>German now owns 14 ATP Tour titles</h3>

<p>Second seed Alexander Zverev was tested from the first point against Stefanos Tsitsipas on Saturday, but he fought through in a thrilling final to claim his 14th ATP Tour title at the Abierto Mexicano Telcel presentado por HSBC.</p>

<p>Zverev turned around an early break in the first set and had to save a set point at 5-6 in the second set, but he stayed cool to move past Tsitsipas 6-4, 7-6(3) after two hours and 19 minutes.</p>

<p>"I've always said that this is definitely a tournament that I wanted to win in my career," Zverev said in his post-match press conference. "I have a very strong relationship with Mexico and with this tournament. I came here with a goal and I achieved it, and I'm very happy with that."</p>

<p>Tsitsipas and Zverev were contesting Acapulco's first final between the top two seeds since 2015, when No. 2 David Ferrer defeated No. 1 Kei Nishikori 6-3, 7-5. Second seed Zverev repeated the pattern for No. 2 seeds to improve to 2-5 in his ATP Head2Head record against Tsitsipas.</p>

<p>"I take this week very positively," said Tsitsipas. "I think it is great being able to play at such an intensity and level. I was very close once again to clinch and get that title, but it wasn't meant to be..... I played well."</p>

<p>The German hadn't dropped a set all week, but he looked uncharacteristically flat at the start of the first set, and Tsitsipas took full advantage as he surged to a 4-1 lead. Zverev faced three break points that would have made it 5-1, with Tsitsipas painting the lines with highlight-reel worthy winners. Zverev found his rhythm with searing backhands, and he reeled off the last five games of the set.</p>

<p>Zverev and Tsitsipas were deadlocked in a tight second set, with only two break points on offer throughout the opening eight games. The second seed broke through first and took a 5-4 lead, but couldn't serve out the match. Tsitsipas saved match point, helped along by a Zverev double fault, to break straight back.</p>

<p>Tsitsipas put in a mammoth effort to save six break points at 5-5 and held a set point in the following game, but he couldn't hold back Zverev. The German converted his third match point to seal his first Acapulco singles title.</p>

<p>"In the beginning I started off extremely bad, I thought I didn't play well at all," Zverev said. "I had to fight my way into the match, and I did well to win the first set. In the second set, when I have a chance I need to close it out against these top players because normally they won't give you a second chance. I thought I played extremely well in the tie-break, I'm happy with how it went."</p>

<p>After the match, Zverev donned a Mexican national team shirt and the winner's traditional blue sombrero, as he lifted Acapulco's signature silver gourd trophy.</p>

<h3>Italian teen becomes ninth Italian in Top 100</h3>

<p>#NextGenATP Lorenzo Musetti reached a milestone today when he cracked the Top 100 in the FedEx ATP Rankings for the first time at World No. 94.</p>

<p>Two years ago, the Italian was unranked. Now, the 19-year-old is the youngest player in the Top 100. Musetti climbed 26 spots from World No. 120 after a tremendous run to the semi-finals of the Abierto Mexicano Telcel presentado por HSBC as a qualifier.</p>

<p>"It's a dream come true. Since I was a kid, I hoped and I dreamed to be one day Top 100 and to enter on the Tour," Musetti said. "Finally, I got this. It is incredible."</p>

<p>There are now two teenagers in the Top 100: Musetti and 2019 Next Gen ATP Finals champion Jannik Sinner, another 19-year-old Italian. Sinner, who is nearly seven months older than Musetti, has great respect for his countryman.</p>

<p>"Musetti is a big, big talent," Sinner said in Dubai last week. "He can do everything with the ball already, so he's already physically strong. I think he's a great player."</p>

<p>Musetti has been one of the ATP Tour's breakthrough stars since tennis resumed last August following a five-month COVID-19 suspension. Former World No. 33 Paolo Lorenzi, an Italian veteran who trains with younger countrymen, believes Musetti made his biggest improvement last year.</p>

<p>"He made a really big step during the lockdown. I saw him playing before and after," Lorenzi said. "I was practising with him before qualifying in Rome and he was playing really unbelievable. It was really impressive. I think he made a big step during lockdown with his coach. They told me they were working really hard and I think that was the key of his new game."</p>

<p>"Before he had good hands, but he was not so strong physically. Of course, he can do everything he was doing before, but the lockdown helped him a lot."</p>

<p>As the World No. 249 at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia, Musetti qualified and upset Stan Wawrinka and Kei Nishikori en route to the third round. The teen has not looked back since. He claimed his maiden ATP Challenger Tour title the following week in Forli and reached his first ATP Tour semi-final in Sardinia.</p>

<p>But Musetti's performance last week in Acapulco was most impressive of all. The 19-year-old qualified, earned his first Top 10 win against Diego Schwartzman, outlasted American Frances Tiafoe in a final-set tie-break and eliminated 2017 Nitto ATP Finals champion Grigor Dimitrov to make his first ATP 500 semi-final. After Musetti's second-round win, his longtime coach, Simone Tartarini, said, "My heart is dead!"</p>

<p>"This week was a dream week. Now Lorenzo is in the Top 100. It's amazing," Tartarini said. "Now it's very important because we changed the schedule for next month. It's the first time Lorenzo has the possibility to enter the main draw of a Slam. It's amazing. I've worked with Lorenzo for 10 years. Lorenzo is a son to me. I have two sons in Italy, and Lorenzo is another son. Me, I'm another father to him. For me, Lorenzo is family."</p>
