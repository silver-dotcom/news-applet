<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 15px;">India will aim to carry the winning momentum</p>
</center>

<hr style="width: 81%; margin-top: 15px;"></hr>

<p>With Test and T20I series in their pocket, India now turn their attention to ODIs with the touring England eyeing to finish their tour on a positive note. Like in Tests, England started the T20Is with a comprehensive win before surrendering the advantage and eventually the series but this is the format where they are the current world champion and the best team by some measure in recent years.</p>

<p>The three-match ODI series, beginning Tuesday in Pune will also provide a chance to struggling India opener Shikhar Dhawan. The series is particularly important for the 35-year-old, who failed to make an impact in the first T20 in Ahmedabad before warming the benches the remaining two games which India won.</p>

<p>With the management having plenty of options in (Shubman Gill) and outside (Prithvi Shaw and Devdutt Padikkal) the squad for the opening slot, it will be a litmus test for ‘Gabbar’ to prove himself in the lung-opener. He is expected to open the innings along with seasoned campaigner Rohit Sharma, who was in blistering form in the T20 series and would be keen to carry on in the same vein.</p>

<p>The ODI format gives Dhawan the time he needs to build his innings. With loads of experience under his belt, the Delhi batsman could well return to form come Tuesday.</p>

<p>For the Indian team, the series would be an extension of its preparations for the T20 World Cup later this year.</p>

<p>The 50-over-format, in general, remains low priority in 2021 with no major tournaments around the corner.</p>

<p>Skipper Virat Kohli was back among the runs in the T20 series against England and he would look to carry the momentum into the ODIs. It has been a while since Kohli scored a hundred in the format, his last and 43rd one coming against the West Indies (114 not out) at Port of Spain in August 2019.</p>

<p>He will be itching to make his good form count and end the century drought. It is also expected that both KL Rahul, who is not likely to feature at the top of the order, and Rishabh Pant, after turning things around spectacularly since the brilliant showing Down Under, would be part of playing XI. They would have a big role in the middle-order along with the redoubtable Hardik Pandya.</p>

<p>There could be a toss-up between Mumbaikars Shreyas Iyer and Suryakumar Yadav, for one spot in the playing XI. Yadav proved himself to be quite a power-hitter in the T20 series, notching up a blistering half century in his maiden international appearance.</p>

<p>The bowling attack is expected to be spearheaded by Bhuvneshwar Kumar, who picked four wickets in the T20 series, and the new ball will be shared by Shardul Thakur. Thakur claimed eight wickets in the T20 series.</p>

<p>Rookie pacer Prasidh Krishna, who has already caught the eye of Kohli, is also in the squad. Krishna enjoyed a good Vijay Hazare Trophy campaign for Karnataka, claiming 14 wickets in seven matches at an average of 24.5. Spinners Yuzvendra Chahal and Washington Sundar are expected to be preferred over Krunal Pandya and Kuldeep Yadav. Also, a fit-again Pandya would be the fifth bowler, but it remains to be seen how many overs he can bowl.</p>

<p>On the other hand, England would also be keen to end the tour on a high after suffering defeats in the Tests (1-3) and the T20 series (2-3). And for it to happen, skipper Eoin Morgan’s role with the bat will be vital.</p>

<p>The likes of Jos Buttler and the swashbuckling Jason Roy will have to fire in unison and all-rounder Ben Stokes will have to step up with both the bat and ball.</p>

<p>England pacer Mark Wood troubled the Indian batters with his pace and in the absence of an injured Jofra Archer, he would have to shoulder greater responsibility along with Chris Jordan and the young Sam Curran.</p>

<p>The spin duo of Moeen Ali and Adil Rashid will have been unable to trouble the Indian batsmen and it remains to be seen whether they have any new tricks to change the dynamics. Additionally, Ali can perform the role of a pinch-hitter, if needed.</p>

<p>All the games at MCA Stadium, Gahunje will be played in front of empty stands as India battles a fresh surge in COVID-19 infections.</p>

<h1>Luus: 'The girls are backing themselves and playing fearless cricket'</h1>

<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 15px;">Laura Wolvaardt and Lizelle Lee were the stars of South Africa's thrilling win</p>
</center>

<hr style="width: 81%; margin-top: 15px;"></hr>

<p>Captain Sune Luus praised South Africa's new-found fearless style of play, which she credited with their double success in India. South Africa won the ODIs 4-1 and sealed the T20I rubber with a game to play, to pick up a first-ever T20I series win over India.</p>

<p>"Our confidence levels are where we want them to be. The girls are backing themselves and playing fearless cricket and in T20s, that's what you want," Luus said at the post-match presentation.</p>

<p>Not only did South Africa claim the T20I trophy, but they pulled off their third-highest chase in the second match, which was also among their most nerve-wracking. They needed 19 runs off the last 10 balls, nine off the final over and six off the last two balls, and Laura Wolvaardt was at the crease to ensure they got them all. She faced all but two deliveries in the 20th over, including the no-ball from Arundhati Reddy that she took two runs off on what would have been the penultimate delivery of the match, and said that eased the mounting pressure.</p>

<p>"A couple of balls before that then there was a full toss which was almost a no-ball and I didn't hit it very well. I thought to myself, 'did I just not score off a full toss?'," Wolvaardt said, referring to the third ball of the final over that went for one. "But then when the [second] full toss came, and we had an extra ball, we didn't need a boundary anymore. For the last ball, we needed one and I said to Nadine (de Klerk) that whatever happens, I am just going to try and get some bat on it. I'm glad it worked out."</p>

<p>South Africa's victory came with an inside-edge off the last ball, avoiding a Super Over, though Wolvaardt admitted things didn't need to get that close. "I didn't start my innings as quickly as I would have liked so I put some pressure on myself, but I knew with a fast outfield, we were in with a chance if we took it deep. I'm glad I was there at the end to do it," she said.</p>

<p>Wolvaardt scored two runs off the first six balls she faced, which included a dropped chance, but with Lizelle Lee on the other end, South Africa were mostly able to keep pace with the required run rate. When Lee and then Mignon du Preez were dismissed, it was up to Wolvaardt and de Klerk to see South Africa home. That they did sends a strong message about the depth in the South African squad.</p>

<p>"It's so good for our future," Luus said. "We know that if on the day we can't play Marizanne Kapp, Shabnim Ismail or Lizelle Lee, there are players coming in and we back them, they back themselves."</p>

<p>South Africa won this T20I series without Kapp, who was rested for the past two matches, and without regular captain Dane van Niekerk and allrounder Chloe Tryon, who are recovering from lower-back injuries. They were also without Luus for two of the ODIs, when she picked up an illness, and Wolvaardt took over the captaincy. In doing so, she also experienced the improvement in the quality of players beyond South Africa's big names.</p>

<p>"In the past, that was one of the gaps between us and the big nations - if we had Dane missing the tour, we would do badly," Wolvaardt said. "Now there is some healthy competition going forward and we are raising the bar for each other. This is also the first time in a long time we are all feeling it (confidence) together. We are starting to click together and performances are coming from every player. If we can ride this wave, that would be awesome."</p>

<p>They have one more opportunity to do that on this strip, with the final match in the series to be played on Tuesday. "There's a chance for us to make it 3-0 and that will be even bigger than a series win," Luus said.</p>

<h1>Archer to miss India ODIs, early IPL season</h1>
<hr></hr>
<p style="font-size: 13px;">By PA</p>

<p>Jofra Archer has been ruled out of England's one-day series against India and will also miss the start of the Indian Premier League due to his ongoing elbow injury.</p>

<p>The latest fitness setback for their key strike bowler will be a cause for concern for England, who view him as integral to their twin goals of the T20 World Cup and the Ashes in Australia later this year.</p>

<p>Archer has just completed five T20 appearances for England in the space of nine days, bowling his maximum allocation of 20 overs, but has been managing a painful right elbow throughout.</p>

<p>He missed two of the four Tests against India as a result of the same issue and is now being sent back home for further assessment. As a result, he will play no part in the three 50-over games in Pune and will no longer join up with Rajasthan Royals for the beginning of the IPL campaign.</p>

<p>Archer, whose deal with the franchise is worth around $A1.4 million, was tournament MVP in the last edition but it is now unclear when or if he will rejoin the Royals.</p>

<p>The fact that Archer is being taken out of the firing line now, rather than playing on and committing to a full two-month IPL schedule, will be seen as a positive by England.</p>

<p>While the injury is causing discomfort, he was still able to bowl quickly and effectively in his recent appearances and has yet to break down.</p>

<p>England head coach Chris Silverwood has previously suggested Archer's workload may need long-term management and it would now be no surprise to see him used carefully over the summer.</p>

<p>Otherwise, the 14-man squad selected for the ODIs on March 23, 26 and 28 is almost identical to that which was narrowly beaten 3-2 by India in the T20 series. Leg-spinner Matt Parkinson has been promoted from the standby list to the main party.</p>

<p>Dawid Malan and Chris Jordan go in the other direction, but will travel and train as reserves alongside seamer Jake Ball.</p>
