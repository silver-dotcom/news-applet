<p>A state of emergency has been declared in the US city of Miami Beach over concerns large crowds gathering for spring break pose a coronavirus risk.</p>

<p>A 20:00-06:00 curfew has been announced in the island city that will remain in effect until at least 12 April. Traffic restrictions are in place during the curfew, while businesses in the busy South Beach area must close.</p>

<p>Miami Beach Mayor Dan Gelber said thousands of tourists had brought "chaos and disorder" to the city. "It feels like a rock concert, wall-to-wall people over blocks and blocks," Mr Gelber told CNN. "If you're coming here to go crazy, go somewhere else."</p>

<p>Spring break is a holiday period for schools and universities in the US that usually takes place in March or April. It attracts thousands of students to Florida and other warm-weather destinations around the country.</p>

<p>Officials warned tourists to "vacation responsibly or be arrested" prior to the holiday period, and a county-wide midnight coronavirus curfew was already in place due to the pandemic. But the Miami Beach area was thronged with revellers over the weekend, and many did not appear to be wearing masks or socially distancing.</p>

<p>One city official described South Beach, which includes the world-famous Ocean Drive, as being "overwhelmed" by crowds on Saturday. "You couldn't see pavement and you couldn't see grass," city manager Raul Aguila said. He added that the emergency measures were "necessary not only to protect our residents but our visitors, including our spring breakers who we want to keep safe".</p>

<p>On Sunday, Miami Beach police told CNN they had arrested at least a dozen people after the curfew had come into force. The Miami Herald newspaper said police used pepper-spray balls to enforce the curfew.</p>

<p>Until the measures are lifted, police will prevent pedestrians and vehicles from entering the South Beach area's main party strips. On Sunday, the Miami Beach city commission voted to extend the curfew and other measures for up to three more weeks.</p>

<p>At an emergency meeting, Mayor Gelber told the commission South Beach had become "a tinder over the last couple of weeks". He said tourists had flooded into the city since Florida Governor Ron DeSantis called the state an "oasis of freedom" from coronavirus restrictions late last month.</p>

<p>Florida continues to be a coronavirus hotspot in the US. The state has recorded nearly two million of the country's 29 million infections since the pandemic began. The latest data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows Florida has recorded about 4,300 new infections a day on average over the past week.</p>

<h1>Donald Trump plans social media comeback, says adviser</h1>
<hr></hr>

<center><img src="file:US2.jpg">
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 15px;">Former US President Donald Trump will soon return to social media "with his own platform", his adviser has said.</p>
</center>

<hr style="width: 81%; margin-top: 15px;"></hr>

<p>"I do think that we're going to see President Trump returning to social media in probably about two or three months," Jason Miller told Fox News. He said the platform "will be the hottest ticket in social media" and would "completely redefine the game".</p>

<p>Mr Trump was suspended from Twitter and Facebook after January's deadly riots at the US Capitol in Washington DC. The attack on 6 January by Trump supporters saw five people including a police officer killed, and shook the foundations of American democracy. Several days later, Twitter said Mr Trump's account - @realDonaldTrump - was "permanently suspended... due to the risk of further incitement of violence".</p>

<p>Mr Trump used Twitter as a way, for more than 10 years, to bypass the traditional media and speak directly to voters. The former president had nearly 90 million followers on the social platform.</p>

<h3>Do we know what platform Mr Trump wants to use?</h3>

<p>Not really.</p>

<p>Mr Miller provided no details on this, saying only that "everybody is going to be waiting and watching to see what exactly President Trump does". The adviser said Mr Trump had already had "high-powered meetings" with various teams regarding the venture at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. "Numerous companies" had already approached the former president, Mr Miller said. "This new platform is going to be big," he added, predicting that Mr Trump would draw "tens of millions of people".</p>

<h3>Why was Trump banned?</h3>

<p>Mr Trump was initially locked out of his Twitter account for 12 hours in January after he called the people who stormed the US Capitol "patriots". Hundreds of his supporters entered the complex as the US Congress attempted to certify Joe Biden's victory in last year's presidential election. Twitter warned then it would ban Mr Trump "permanently" if he breached the platform's rules again. After being allowed back on Twitter, Mr Trump posted two tweets that the company cited as the final straws. The social media company said both of these tweets were "in violation of the Glorification of Violence Policy".</p>

<p>Mr Trump's accounts were also suspended on Facebook, popular gaming platform Twitch and multimedia messaging app Snapchat.</p>

<h1>Atlanta spa shootings: How we talk about violence</h1>
<hr></hr>

<p>In the wake of the Atlanta shootings, police offered early explanations for why the deadly rampage had occurred. But some experts say the speculation around motive drew from harmful stereotypes.</p>

<p>The morning after the Atlanta spa shootings, local law enforcement called a news conference. The suspect, 21-year-old Robert Aaron Long, had confessed to the shooting rampage, police said, in which eight people were killed, six of them Asian women.</p>

<p>Asked by reporters about a possible motive, Cherokee Police spokesman Capt Jay Baker replied that Mr Long had denied a racial motivation. The gunman said he was struggling with a sex addiction, Capt Baker said, and had attempted "to take out that temptation". "Yesterday was a really bad day for him, and this is what he did," Capt Baker said.</p>

<p>Those responses, in the wake of the deadly tragedy, caused anger. </p>

<hr style="width: 81%; margin-top: 15px;"></hr>
<p></p>
<center><img src="file:US5.jpg">
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 15px;">Police spokesman Jay Baker has been moved off the case after saying the assailant had a "bad day" prior to the shooting</p>
</center>

<hr style="width: 81%; margin-top: 15px;"></hr>

<p>It was also later discovered that Capt Baker had made controversial Facebook posts related to China and the coronavirus. By Thursday, the Sheriff's office had formally apologised and Capt Baker had been moved off the case.</p>

<p>To many, the news conference as a whole followed a well-worn storyline. Here is what three experts in Asian-American studies said they heard.</p>

<h3>'This is still early, but he does claim that it was not racially motivated.'</h3>

<p>As news of the shooting spread, it soon became clear that at least six of the victims were Asian-American women, targeted in Asian-owned businesses.

The ethnicity of the victims - combined with the recent rise of hate crimes against Asian Americans - gave way to a prevailing theory in the media and online: that the shooting had been racially motivated.</p>

<p>But the notion was cast into doubt by Capt Baker as he relayed the suspect's testimony.

"During our interviews, we asked that specific question, and that did not appear to be the motive," Capt Baker said.

The answer - and Capt Baker's confidence - was "striking", said Ellen Wu, a professor of history and Asian-American studies at Indiana University.</p>

<p>"It's a complete disavowal."</p>

<p>Letting Mr Long decide for himself whether race was involved ignores the tacit expressions of racism in the US, said Vivian Truong, a historian and post-doctoral fellow in Asian studies at Vassar College.</p>

<p>"Just because someone doesn't come out and say 'I was targeting these women because of their race' - there's still a deeper history of Asian American women being associated with hyper-sexuality, with this kind of immoral or corrupting influence," Ms Truong said.</p>

<p>And attention has been turned to the suspect, his thought process and his version of events.</p>

<p>"I'm tired of this focus on motivation," Prof Wu said. "I think we should think about the impact, the consequences, and look at the outcome of what happened - that eight people are dead."</p>


<h3>'It's a temptation for him that he wants to eliminate.'</h3>

<p>According to police, the massage parlours terrorised by the suspect were outlets for his reported sexual addiction.

"It's something that he shouldn't be doing," Capt Baker said of the gunman's mindset. "He was attempting to take out that temptation."</p>

<p>Experts say "temptation" is a loaded term. "That word, temptation, points to a long history of the evil within our midst," Prof Wu said.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 15px;">Early explanations for the deadly Atlanta shooting by police sparked outrage</p>
</center>

<hr style="width: 81%; margin-top: 15px;"></hr>

<p>Both Prof Wu and Ms Truong cited the 1875 Page Act, one of the earliest pieces of federal law restricting immigration to the US. On paper, the legislation barred the entry of any woman from China, Japan "or any Oriental country" for "lewd and immoral purposes", including prostitution.</p>

<p>In reality, the law blocked virtually all immigration from Asian women, who were collectively presumed to be sex workers or prostitutes. This racist and sexist stereotype that they "were bringing their immorality to the US", Ms Truong explains, has lingered. And describing a "temptation" that haunted the suspect pushes responsibility away from him and on to the women he killed, she says.</p>

<p>Framed this way, the problem is "the existence of these massage parlours, or the actions of these women", said Ms Truong. "The issue is not with him."</p>


<h3>'He understood the gravity of it. He was pretty much fed up and at the end of his rope and yesterday was a really bad day for him and this is what he did.'</h3>

<p>When Mr Long embarked on his shooting spree, Capt Baker said he "may have been lashing out".</p>

<p>The night he killed eight people had come at the end of a "really bad day for him", Capt Baker continued. "And this is what he did."</p>

<p>Ms Truong said this was the quote that struck her - that the murder of eight people could seemingly be blamed on a "bad day".</p>

</center>

<hr style="width: 81%; margin-top: 15px;"></hr>

<p>There's a parallel, Ms Truong said, in this week's statement and one made during the trial of former Stanford student Brock Turner, who was convicted in the sexual assault of Chanel Miller. In court, Turner's father argued that his son should not have to go to prison for "20 minutes of action" - referring to the rape of Ms Miller.</p>

<p>These acts of violence are cast as "temporary lapses by these white men," Ms Truong said.</p>

<p>The message is that these men are innocent, except for that one bad day.</p>
