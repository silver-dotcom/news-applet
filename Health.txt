<p>Here are the benefits and steps to nail Yogaâ€™s Cat-Cow stretch or Chakravakasana if you feel numbness, tingling sensations in the hands from all that typing, obesity, stiffness in the lower back or cervical pain due to sitting at the office desk for long or while working from home.</p>

<p>The Covid-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdowns have had a disastrous impact on the livelihoods of people as they juggled work, family responsibilities and household chores all while packed within the four walls of their house which left little or no time to prioritise exercising. Frequent numbness, tingling sensations in the hands from all those hours of rigorous typing, obesity, stiffness in the lower back and cervical pain are some of the common health hazards reported by office-goers sitting at the office desk for long durations or those working from home.</p>

<h3>Chakravakasana</h3>

<p>Also called the cat-cow stretch, this Yoga asana targets the spine and abdominals and involves moving the spine from a rounded position (flexion) to an arched position (extension).</p>

<h3>Method:</h3>

<p>Stand on all fours to form a table top with your back while your hands and feet from its legs. Keep your arms perpendicular to the floor and place your hands flat on the floor, right under your shoulders while keeping your knees hip-width apart.</p>

<p>Curl your toes under and tilt your pelvis back so that your tailbone sticks up. Without moving your neck, let this movement ripple from your tailbone up your spine while letting your belly drop down.</p>

<p>Draw your navel in and keep your abdominal muscles hugging your spine. Now, without cranking your neck, take your gaze gently up towards the ceiling.</p>

<p>All this arching was for the cow pose while inhaling and now for rounding the cat pose, exhale and release the toes you had curled. Tucking your tailbone, tip your pelvis forward and let this action move up your spine again to make it naturally round.</p>

<p>Draw your navel towards your spine, drop your head and take your gaze to your navel. Matching the movement to your own breath, repeat the Cat-Cow Stretch on each inhale and exhale for 5 to 10 breaths.</p>

<h3>Benefits:</h3>

<p>Apart from supporting the back and easing pain, this exercise helps maintain a healthy spine during those long work duration before a computer screen by helping in improving the circulation in the discs in your back. The calming pose works as a good stress- reliever apart from helping one to improve their posture and balance.</p>

<h1>Covid-19 induced lockdown negatively impacted mental health of teenagers: Study</h1>
<hr></hr>

<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 15px;">Teens' mental health negatively impacted by pandemic, reveals poll conducted in US</p>
</center>

<hr style="width: 81%; margin-top: 15px;"></hr>

<p>The findings of a new study show that the lockdown which was induced to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus in March 2020 has taken a toll on mental health of teenagers. Parents say their children have shown signs of new or worsening mental health condition during this time.</p>

<p>The findings of a national poll suggests that the Covid-19 induced lockdown may have taken a heavy toll on the mental health of teenagers.</p>

<p>Forty-six per cent of parents say their teen has shown signs of a new or worsening mental health condition since the start of the pandemic in March 2020, according to the CS Mott Children's Hospital National Poll on Children's Health at Michigan Medicine.</p>

<p>Parents of teen girls were more likely to say their child had a new onset or worsening of depressive symptoms and anxiety than parents of teen boys.</p>

<p>"Just as young people are at the age of being biologically primed to seek independence from their families, Covid-19 precautions have kept them at home," says poll co-director and Mott paediatrician Gary L. Freed, MD, MPH.</p>

<p>"Pandemic-related lifestyle changes have wreaked havoc on teens' lives, with many experiencing disruptions to their normal routines. Our poll suggests that pandemic-era changes may have had a significant mental health impact for some teenagers."</p>

<p>The nationally representative report is based on responses from 977 parents of teens ages 13-18.</p>

<p>One in three teen girls and one in five teen boys have experienced new or worsening anxiety, the poll suggests. More parents of teen girls than parents of teen boys note an increase in anxiety/worry (36 per cent vs. 19 per cent ) or depression/sadness (31 per cent vs. 18 per cent).</p>

<p>But similar proportions of parents report negative changes in their teen's sleep (24 per cent for girls vs. 21 per cent for boys), withdrawing from family (14 per cent vs. 13 per cent ) and aggressive behaviour (8 per cent vs. 9 per cent).</p>

<p>Recent research has shown teen depression during the pandemic to be associated with teens' own fears and uncertainties, as well as high levels of parental stress, Freed notes.</p>

<p>"Isolation during the pandemic may be triggering new problems for some teens but for others, the situation has exacerbated existing emotional health issues," Freed says.</p>

<p>Parents in the poll say their kids seem hardest hit by changes in social interactions over the last year, with three in four reporting a negative impact on their teen's connections to friends.</p>

<p>Many parents say their teens have been texting (64 per cent), using social media (56 per cent), online gaming (43 per cent), and talking on the phone (35 per cent) every day or almost every day. Few parents say their teens have been getting together in person with friends daily or almost every day, indoors (9 per cent) or outdoors (6 per cent).</p>

<p>"Peer groups and social interactions are a critical part of development during adolescence. But these opportunities have been limited during the pandemic," Freed says. "Many teens may feel frustrated, anxious and disconnected due to social distancing and missing usual social outlets, like sports, extracurricular activities and hanging out with friends."</p>

<p>Parents who note negative changes in their teens' mental health have tried different strategies to help their teen, the Mott Poll suggests, including relaxing Covid-19 rules and family rules on social media, seeking professional help and even using mental health apps.</p>

<p>"Parents play a critical role in helping their teens cope with the stress of the pandemic," Freed says. "There are strategies parents can engage to help, whether or not their teen is showing signs of problems. One of the most important things for parents to do is keep lines of communication open; ask their teen how they are doing and create the space for them to speak honestly so they can provide help when needed."</p>

<h1>What is Kawasaki Syndrome?</h1>
<hr></hr>

<p>Kawasaki Syndrome is a rare medical condition that mostly affects children under the age of five. The disease affects blood vessels, skin, mouth and lymph nodes. The coronary arteries that carry blood to the heart muscle may also get damaged with this illness. The exact reason of Kawasaki Syndrome is not known.</p>

<p>However, most cases are reported during early spring and in late winter. A few symptoms that may appear when a child gets affected with Kawasaki Syndrome are red eyes, rashes on the body, red and swollen feet and hands, swollen lymph nodes in the neck and fever that last for at least five days. Some symptoms appear within two weeks of the fever. The skin on the hands and even feet might start to peel off and some children might get affected by arthritis or joint pain, which is usually temporary. However, some other signs and symptoms include diarrhea, vomiting, temporary loss of hearing, enlarged gallbladder and constant pain in stomach.</p>

<p>If you notice the above signs and symptoms in your child, immediately consult a doctor. If Kawasaki Syndrome is treated timely, it may prevent heart diseases that might affect the patient at a later age. Children of Asian descent are at a greater risk of getting affected by Kawasaki Syndrome. According to Kawasaki Disease Foundation (KDF), about 75 per cent of children who are affected by this illness are under the age of five.It may take a few weeks before the child feels perfectly fine.</p>

<p>The sooner the Kawasaki Syndrome is treated, lower are the chances of any long-term health issues. There are no evident theories that show children can inherit this disease but the risk factor may increase within families if it affects one of the family members.</p>
